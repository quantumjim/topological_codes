# Topological Codes

The aim of this folder is to have a go at implementing topological codes and their decoders. The `TopologicalQEC.py` file currently contains two classes: one to define the repetition code, and the other to define a generic collection of decoders that should be usable on any topological code.

The `repetition_code_tutorial.ipynb` is a tutorial for how to use the tools, as well as a good way to see if they are still working when changes to `TopologicalQEC.py` are made.

The code is not compatible with current Qiskit, but it works with `qiskit==0.7.1`.
